## Themetime

Simple daemon running a themeset script (or any script for that matter) on first run and subsequent sunsets and sunrises calculated based on the timezone.

Sunset/sunrise calculations are based on https://github.com/troglobit/sun code, which itself is based on code by [Paul Schlyter](http://stjarnhimlen.se/).

Part of the [MARBS desktop environment](https://marbs.kuchta.dev/).
